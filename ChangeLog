TODO

* windows search
  - change libuna utf16 functions to libsystem utf16 functions
  - create libsystm utf16 functions

* read catalog data type defintions and convert them into column definitions
* use column definitions to read data definitions

Error:
* error in libbfio offset tracking ?
  20987904 ( 0x01404000 ) - 20996096 ( 0x01406000 ) size: 8192
  4290912256 ( 0xffc22000 ) - 4290912256 ( 0xffc22000 ) size: 0

Debug
* is function libesedb_debug_print_table_group_of_bits needed?

Library
* compare primary and secondary file header
  - report any differences
* compare primary and secondary catalog
* provide UTF-16 name string functions
* limit the amount of active data type definitions for large tables?

* libfwintype
  - change GUID function to match libfdatetime like structure

Tools
* esedbinfo
  - page summary (scan for uninitialized, empty, etc. pages)
  - file header summary (check backup file header)
  - summary of catalog (check backup catalog)
  - print
    - database state

File format
* where is the root object defined? or is it implied to be object 1?
* flag 0x4000 in tagged values
* page flags
* long values
* page keys

Deployment:
* update manuals
* create debian package files
* update macosx package files
* update codegear files
* check msvcpp files

Notes
* a full page table will take up too much memory for large databases
* create a root page table instead?
