TODO

Debug
* is function libesedb_debug_print_table_group_of_bits needed?

Library
* compare primary and secondary file header
  - report any differences
* provide UTF-16 name string functions
* merge table and index into single item type ?
* make data definition type more flexible
  - allow reading a table definition
  - define the catalog table as a table definition? and bootstrap it
* bind get index to table type not file type

Tools
* esedbinfo
  - page summary (scan for uninitialized, empty, etc. pages)
  - file header summary (check backup file header)
  - summary of catalog (check backup catalog)
  - print
    - database state

File format
* where is the root object defined? or is it implied to be object 1?

Deployment:
* update manuals
* create debian package files
* update macosx package files
* update codegear files
* check msvcpp files

Notes
* a full page table will take up too much memory for large databases
* create a root page table instead?
