* merge table and index into single item type ?

Tools
* esedbinfo
  - page summary (scan for uninitialized, empty, etc. pages)
  - file header summary (check backup file header)
  - summary of catalog (check backup catalog)
  - print
    - database state

File format
* where is the root object defined? or is it implied to be object 1?

Deployment:
* update manuals
* create debian package files
* update macosx package files

* check msvcpp files

Notes
* a full page table will take up too much memory for large databases
* create a root page table instead?
