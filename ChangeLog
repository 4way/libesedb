TODO
* fix memory leaks
* configure.ac update libfguid detection
* update macosx files
* parse variable types even when they are not part of the table catalog definition
* add support for build in table number 1
* move bfio handle to item layer
* implement cloning of items for improved asynchronous and multi threaded usage
* long values optimization
  - read page tree as hierarchy
  - throttle pages to reduce memory finger print
  - read long values on demand, do not store data ?

Library:
* ECC32 check non 4 byte modulus buffer support
* long value support
* template table support (what about non-tagged data types)
* multi value 0x18 support
* read catalog data type defintions and convert them into column definitions
* use column definitions to read data definitions
* compare primary and secondary file header
  - report any differences
* compare primary and secondary catalog
* provide UTF-16 name string functions
* limit the amount of active data type definitions for large tables?
* libfguid
  - change GUID function to match libfdatetime like structure
* support for non-linear stored long value segments
  - current solution has sanity check
* default values
   - apply to data definition

Debug
* print file type string
* is function libesedb_debug_print_table_group_of_bits needed?
* print value flags

Tools
* esedbinfo
  - page summary (scan for uninitialized, empty, etc. pages)
  - file header summary (check backup file header)
  - summary of catalog (check backup catalog)
  - print
    - database state
* esedbexport
  - move libesedb file handle from export handle to esedbexport

Windows search:
* improve windows_search_decompress_byte_indexed_compressed_data

File format
* where is the root object defined? or is it implied to be object 1?
* flag 0x4000 in tagged values
* page flags
* page keys
* (revision 0x11) extended page header
* multi value 0x18 support
* what about the first byte in 7-bit ascii compressed data
* codepage 1200 string in Exchange EDB starts with 0xff 0xff

Deployment:
* update manuals
  - add esedbexport.1
* create debian package files
* add codegear files

Performance
* create data definition tree in page tree for faster lookup of keys
  keep list for sequential access (B+-tree)
* XOR32 add memory alignment support
* create a UTF-8 version of run-length compressed UTF-16 string decompression function

Test suite:
* windows search: work on index-based compression
  - create test program to validate output

Notes
* a full page table will take up too much memory for large databases
* create a root page table instead?
